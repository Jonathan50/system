This is a mini GNU/Linux distribution for the Scratch competition: https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/259060/

To build everything and install it:
  PACKAGE_DIRECTORY=`pwd`
  TARGET=x86_64
  (cd package; gcc -O3 -Wall package.c -o package)
  package/package build
  su
  PACKAGE_DIRECTORY=`pwd`
  TARGET=x86_64
  ROOT= # put root directory for new system here
  package/package install

You can now load a bootloader on it, configure the bootloader, and boot it.
